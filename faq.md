# FAQ - AT Player
# Download
## How do I download songs for offline listening?
To download songs, navigate to the 'Download' tab in the app. Here, you'll find buttons next to each song to start the download process. Once downloaded, the songs will be stored for offline listening under the 'Offline' tab. You can choose from a vast library of over 30 million tracks available for download. For a visual guide, watch our demo video at atplayer.com/dl

## Why can't I download a song?
Ensure you've selected the 'Download' tab in the app. Pick your desired genre and use the download button next to the songs. If you still face issues, remember we are continuously updating our library to provide you with a vast selection of songs.

## How do I monitor the download progress?
A message will notify you once the download for a track is completed.

## What about the quality and bitrate of downloads?
The quality varies among songs. For the best results, explore different tracks or use the search function. Most tracks are typically downloaded at high bitrates, with 320 kb/s for mp3 being common. Although FLAC format is not available for download, our player can play FLAC tracks that you might have on your device.

## Where are the songs saved after download?
Downloaded songs are saved in the internal memory of your device under "/Music/atplayer". You can also access them directly through the 'Offline' tab in the AT Player.

## Can I download YouTube videos?
Due to YouTube's regulations, you cannot download its videos. However, you can explore the 'Download: Not YouTube' section in the app for a plethora of similar tracks, including DJ sets, remixes, and exclusive content. Our library boasts over 30 million tracks for your discovery.

## When will video download support be available?
We're planning to incorporate video download functionality in our future versions. This feature will exclude YouTube videos, but there will be other options to explore.

## How do I download from my Dropbox account?
Navigate to 'Download from Dropbox' in the main menu. Sign in with your Dropbox account, grant the necessary permissions, and choose your desired music or videos for download. Remember, you can enjoy music playback even with the screen turned off.

## What about downloading movies?
While YouTube doesn't permit the download of films, you can save data and storage by watching movies online through our platform. You'll find a selection of films on the home page.

## Can I download music from YouTube with this app?
No, while AT Music Player allows you to stream content from YouTube, downloading from YouTube directly violates its terms of service. However, our app offers over 30 million tracks from other sources for offline listening.

## How can I access my YouTube playlist offline?
Unfortunately, due to YouTube's terms of service, you cannot download or access YouTube playlists offline directly. A potential workaround is to create local playlists within AT Player, combining both online and offline songs. The player will play the entire playlist when online and only the local tracks when offline.

# Offline Playback
## How can I play music offline or without internet?
The AT Music Player operates in both online and offline modes. For offline listening, you can access any music stored in your device's internal memory. If you haven't stored any songs for offline use yet, head to the 'Download' tab in the app. Over 30 million songs are available for you to download. However, please note that for online music streaming and radio, an internet connection is required. This is especially true for content from YouTube, as they currently prohibit offline listening. We're always adapting to platform changes, so if YouTube eventually allows offline playback, we will integrate that feature.

## Data Consumption
How can I stream audio without video to save bandwidth?
While we understand the appeal of streaming just audio to save on bandwidth, separating audio and video streams is against YouTube's terms of use. For a less data-intensive experience, consider listening to music stored offline or tunes from the 'Download' tab or radio, which don't stream with video. Additionally, you can turn off your device's display to further save on data.

## How can I minimize data usage while using the app?
To conserve your data:
* Use the "Wifi only" setting: Activate the "Wifi only" option in the player's settings. This ensures the app only streams music when connected to Wifi.
* Listen Offline: Access music from the 'Offline' tab. This plays songs stored on your device and doesn't consume any data.
* Minimize Video Quality: If you're streaming YouTube videos, use the player's minimum size and select a lower quality option. If you're on Android 9 or above, you can adjust the video quality using the pinion button located at the bottom right corner of the video player.
* Radio Streaming: Opt for radio streaming, as it consumes significantly less data compared to video streaming.

With AT Player, you access a diverse range of music from YouTube, totaling 300+ million music videos. Our supplemental sources offer mixes and covers exclusive to our platform, ensuring a unique listening experience.
